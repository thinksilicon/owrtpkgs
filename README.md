Image::Scale for openwrt

This will build the fast, high-quality fixed-point image resizing for openwrt platforms.
It depends on the packages/lang/perl repository and needs libjpeg and libpng.

Currently I don't know how to properly set the include-directories. If the build fails
set the correct directory in the .patch-file.

drop-in replacement for Perl threads using fork(). Comes with all dependencies:
